# 3D-Shooter - OpenGL City Scene Simulation

This project is a real-time 3D simulation created with OpenGL, GLFW, and Glad using C++. It features a road scene with buildings on both sides, interactive lighting, and a dramatic sequence where a fascist character moves along a predefined path with oscillating motion on the X, Y, and Z axes. When the fascist appears, a fire is shot, and upon being hit, the fascist dies while a victory tune plays in the background.
